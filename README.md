# Final Project
### Overview

For this project I chose to examine my top 100 song playlists, created by Spotify, over the past three years. I took the metadata from 300 songs, cleaned it, sorted it, and analyzed it for easily broken down visual representaions.  Using the minmax scaler I was able to normalize all of the meta data values that I deemed important, and give them all set boundaries.

### Results

Over the past few years, my listening trends have shifted away from songs with acoustic properties and towards songs with longer durations and less instrumentalness.  Which checks out, since I have been listening to more and more electronic music over the past few years.

### Future Uses

Being able to view and use the cleaned data is incredibly beneficial. Not just for a user like myself to track personal data, by Spotify employees to see how well it pairs with their own models and predictions.  With access to the weekly and daily recommended playlists, it would be easy to compare trends and see just how much the recommendations influence the users' listening choices.
